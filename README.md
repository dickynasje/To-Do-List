# To-Do-List
my attempt at learning html, css, and js with a youtube video (dont expect much from it as i copied a lot of things) <- first commit

Hate dealing with git errors, so i just published it automatically via vscode
this is a completed version of my previous todo list that i deleted because of the reason above
awesome
